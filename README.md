- ⛅️ Hi, I’m @willob351, or Willow in real life
- 🌷 I'm an undergrad computer science and microbiology student in Galway, Ireland
- 🌼 I’m interested in building programs, convincing people that coding is just a skill and not magic, and computational biology
- 💞️ When I'm off the computer, I love mycology, gardening, and my current hobby is book binding (if anyone needs a tiny notebook, lemme know!)
- 🌱 I’m currently on the learning curve of C, and mostly code in Java or Python
